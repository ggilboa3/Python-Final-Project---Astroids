# 🛰️ Asteroid Data Analysis Project

## 🌐 Overview

This repository showcases a comprehensive data analysis project conducted as part of a Python-based data science course at the **Open University of Israel**.  
The project explores **NASA's Near-Earth Object (NEO)** dataset to extract meaningful insights about asteroids — including their magnitude, estimated size, proximity to Earth, and orbital characteristics.  

The analysis focuses on transforming raw CSV data into valuable knowledge using Python, with visualizations that highlight key patterns and correlations.

## 🔍 Features

- **Data Cleaning**  
  Addressed missing values and ensured data consistency using Pandas.

- **Filtering by Proximity to Earth**  
  Identified asteroids with potentially hazardous proximity using distance-based criteria.

- **Magnitude & Diameter Correlation**  
  Explored the relationship between asteroid brightness and size.

- **Orbit Analysis**  
  Counted and visualized asteroid distributions across orbit types.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Created charts and graphs using Matplotlib to enhance interpretability.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is derived from NASA's **Near-Earth Object (NEO) Database**.  
It includes the following features:
- Name  
- Close Approach Date  
- Absolute Magnitude  
- Estimated Diameter (min/max in KM)  
- Miss Distance (KM)  
- Orbit ID  
- Minimum Orbit Intersection  
- Speed (Miles per Hour)  
- Hazardous Classification  

> **Note:** A mock dataset was generated for demonstration and testing purposes (`mock_asteroid_data.csv`).
